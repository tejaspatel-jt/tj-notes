## Assignment Feedback

### Things Done Right: 
- CSS CSS done for the slider is working fine. 
- Responsive CSS Proper use of responsive breakpoints. 
- HTML: HTML is done right. 
- Modular Functions approach: Functions are well-defined and modular, making the code easy to understand and maintain. 
- Comments: Good use of comments to explain the code, siding in g in readability and maintenance. 

### Areas of Improvement: 
- Global Variables: Encapsulating global variables like slide index, is Paused, and slide Interval within an object or a closure would prevent potential conflicts, - - Error Handling: Adding error handling for cases where elements might not be found (e.g. document.querySelector) would make the code more robust. 
- JavaScript: Js written for this slider is unable to handle multiple instances at a time on a single page. 
- Aria-labels: Aria labels are used but not property

### Final Recommendation; Hold 
We can hold him for now until we find the best candidate, Can you share few more proflies who we can review and take a decision. 
We can work with him, but he would need training for around a week (Accessibility, WordPress, our frontend build) to start working independently with us, for this contractual role we are looking for a candidate who can start quickly and independently,

Thanks,
