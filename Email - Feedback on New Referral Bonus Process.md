## Subject: Feedback on New Referral Bonus Process

Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. As someone who has previously worked as a recruiter, I understand how eagerly employees anticipate their referral bonuses. However, I would like to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the new process for claiming these bonuses.

### Current Process Concerns

The requirement to create a helpdesk ticket in order to receive the referral bonus seems somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, such processes are automated within the system or managed directly by the HR department. In many organizations, the responsibility for tracking and disbursing referral bonuses lies solely with HR, particularly once the referred employee has completed their six-month tenure.

It appears that this new policy may have been implemented due to difficulties in tracking these milestones within our department. While I appreciate the intent behind it, I believe it places an unnecessary burden on employees or on other department to remind and request bonuses that should be automatically processed.

### Reflection on Company Standards

Moreover, if we consider and keep saying ourselves a large company, it raises the question of why we are adopting practices more commonly associated with smaller organizations. In larger firms, such processes are typically streamlined and managed efficiently by HR without requiring constant reminders from employees. This current approach feels somewhat disheartening, as it suggests a lack of confidence in our ability to manage these processes effectively.

### Suggestion for Improvement
As I live on the floor and have heard from colleagues about their concerns regarding this new policy, I suggest that we complete any pending bonuses for existing referrals under the previous system. This would help maintain a positive atmosphere and ensure fairness for those who have already referred candidates. The new policy could then apply only to future referrals. Since I was involved in recruiting these candidates, I believe this approach would foster goodwill among employees.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, I understand that it is the company's prerogative to establish and enforce its policies. However, I felt it was important to share my perspective as both a former recruiter and a member of the Core Support Team. I believe that revisiting this process could enhance employee satisfaction and reflect our commitment to maintaining a professional and efficient work environment.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I am open to discussing this matter further if needed.

The necessity of submitting a helpdesk ticket for the referral bonus feels inefficient. In many organizations, this process is automated or managed directly by HR once the referred employee completes their six-month tenure. This change seems to stem from difficulties in tracking these milestones within our department, which places an undue burden on employees to remind and request bonuses that should ideally be processed automatically.

Furthermore, if we consider ourselves a large company, it raises the question of why we are adopting practices more typical of smaller organizations. Larger firms usually streamline such processes through HR without requiring constant reminders from employees. This current approach can feel disheartening, suggesting a lack of confidence in our ability to manage these processes effectively.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, I recognize that it is the company's prerogative to establish and enforce its policies. However, I felt it was important to share my perspective as both a former recruiter and a member of the Core Support Team. I believe that revisiting this process could lead to greater employee satisfaction and better reflect our commitment to maintaining a professional and efficient work environment.
