## Request to Lower Office Temperature

Dear Amitesh,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the office temperature.

I understand that discomfort can arise from varying preferences, and I appreciate your concern for maintaining a productive environment.Unfortunately, I am unable to adjust the temperature settings for individual requests, as doing so could negatively impact the comfort of others in the office.

According to our policy, the temperature will remain set at 26Â°C for now.As we transition out of winter, we will certainly explore options to enhance cooling in the coming weeks.

Your understanding and patience in this matter are greatly appreciated.
