A Janmashtami to Remember: How We Celebrated at Vaikunthdham Gaushala 🙏🐄

🌟 Had a heartwarming experience this Janmashtami visiting Vaikunthdham Gaushala, established by the 4 Legs Rescue Foundation! 🐮 We spent our morning surrounded by animals who were once injured and abandoned by their owners. The dedication of the volunteers in treating and caring for them is truly commendable. 💖

🙏 Impressed by their noble initiative, we couldn't help but share some glimpses of our visit. Take a look at the impeccable cleanliness and the unique names for each shed, dedicated to Krishna's name. 🕊️

🐄 At the 4 Legs Foundation, they rescue and care for large animals like cows, camels, and horses. With two ambulances and a dedicated team of doctors and caretakers, they leave no stone unturned in ensuring the well-being of these animals. 👨‍⚕️🚑

👏 Kudos to the Jignect Charity Unit team for discovering and planning such meaningful visits. Let's continue to support and appreciate the remarkable work being done for our beloved animals! 🌿
