### Nidhi
Everything going well. I have not worked with her directly but have seen her working in our group and she is communicating well on result verification or anything she is working.

I have not worked with her directly so not sure about this but yes things always can be done better.

We are working together indirectly since long and have not heard anything negative about her so the overall impact is excellent.

We are working together but indirectly so i can't give any feedback from my standpoint.

Everything is going well. 
I worked with him when I joined AH and it's quite good to work with him.
He knows the functionality very well so it is easy for me to reach out and clear any doubt on the fly.
He communicates well in groups and in person too.

yes things always can be done better.

We are working together in beginning and now in diff team  but have not heard anything negative about him so the overall impact is excellent. and he is doing excellent in OE team.

Attention to detail can be improved, once in a moon , small bug can be left so yes more attention can avoid this as well and rest is alreaady awesome.
