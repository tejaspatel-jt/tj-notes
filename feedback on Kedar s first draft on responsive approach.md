@Kedar Kulkarni Thank you for the draft you have shared., which includes the following things majorly.

What is responsive design ?
The folder structure of AH's .net and react projects.
Steps needed to make this both the projects responsive.
Basic guide on CSS media queries with latest breakpoints and which are the one to be used for our AH project.

But from all of this, it's not clear What's the first step we should take to make any single page responsive ?

:point_right: At least we need below items in order to have idea about how we will carry forward your approach.

What are the must required changes which are common for any screens and being used all over the app commonly like Top nav, left nav , Profile action buttons, all different sizes of popups and tables (MAJOR PART of whole app).
How much time it takes to do it for any new screen other than this common things.
How many common css media query code which is must needed in every new screen but with little changes as per the screen design.

Please let me know if you have any questions. @Kedar Kulkarni
