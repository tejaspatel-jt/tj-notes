Unfortunately, due to the current power outage, we are facing difficulties in managing TEA (tea)
 services. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.

We will resume normal services as soon as the power is restored.

Thank you for your cooperation.

⚠️ Important Notice ⚠️

We are facing some difficulties with the cafeteria 🚪 door, and it will remain open 🟢 until the issue is resolved.

Kindly avoid closing it 🙏, as it could potentially break the entire glass ❗❗

Thank you for your cooperation 😊.
