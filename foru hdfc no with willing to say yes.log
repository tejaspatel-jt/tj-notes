Subject: Gratitude for the Offer and Salary Negotiation

Dear team,

I trust this email finds you well. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for extending the offer for the "Customer Care Executive" role at HDFC Bank. It is an exciting opportunity, and I am appreciative of the trust and confidence the bank has shown in considering me for this position.

After careful consideration, however, I find myself in a position where the offered compensation doesn't align with my expectations given my experience and skills. I value the opportunity to be a part of HDFC Bank, but I believe a revision in the salary package would be more in line with the market standards for my qualifications.

I am genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to HDFC Bank's success. My 5 of experience in Banking field and proficiency in Communications with customers & team, Mentoring and Multitasking have equipped me to make significant contributions to your team.

I would be more than willing to discuss this further and provide any additional information required for reassessment. I am confident that a mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, and I am open to negotiations.

I understand that budgets and constraints are factors in determining compensation, and I am hopeful that HDFC Bank recognizes the value I can bring to the team. If there is room for adjustment, I am ready and eager to accept the offer and contribute my best to the success of HDFC Bank.

Thank you again for this opportunity, and I look forward to the possibility of further discussion regarding the terms.

Warm regards,

Foram Polara
