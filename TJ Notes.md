## JS Array Methods
- push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
- shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
-unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- map() returns a new array with transformed elements.
- filter() returns a new array with elements that meet a condition.
- find() returns the first element that meets a condition or undefined.
- reduce() returns a single value that is the result of accumulating values from the array.
- .splice(index, noOfItemsTobeRemoved, item1, ....., itemX) method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place AND returns an array containing the deleted elements.
- slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included).
```
Positive Index:   0         1        2       3      4
Fruits:       ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"]

Negative Index:  -5        -4       -3      -2     -1
```
- concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays but instead returns a new array.
- every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.
-  includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

### This
- The value of this is determined by how a function is called, not where it is defined.
- In global context, this refers to the global object.
- In object methods, this refers to the object itself.
- In constructor functions, this refers to the new instance.
- Arrow functions inherit this from their enclosing scope.
- In event handlers, this refers to the element that triggered the event.
- You can manually set the value of this using call(), apply(), and bind().

### Function
- Use call() when you want to invoke a function immediately with a specific this context and individual arguments.
- Use apply() when you want to invoke a function immediately with a specific this context and an array of arguments.
- Use bind() when you want to create a new function with a specific this context that can be called later, optionally pre-filling some arguments. 

##### Hoisting Behavior
- var: Hoisted and initialized with undefined. Can be accessed before declaration, but will return undefined.
- let and const: Hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the Temporal Dead Zone.
- Function Declarations: Hoisted and can be called before their declaration.

### Concepts
- void(0) is used to call another method without refreshing the page during the calling time parameter “zero” will be passed.
```
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showMessage()">Click me!</a>
```
- `Debouncing` ensures that a function is only executed after a certain amount of idle time, i.e., it delays the execution until the event stops triggering for a specified time (e.g., for search input).
- `Throttling` limits the number of times a function can be executed in a given period, ensuring it runs at regular intervals (e.g., during scroll or window resizing).
- `Promise` callbacks (microtasks) are executed before `setTimeout` (macrotasks).

Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. 

As someone who has previously worked as a recruiter, I understand how eagerly employees anticipate their referral bonuses. 
However, I would like to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the new process for claiming these bonuses.

### Current Process Concerns

The requirement to create a helpdesk ticket in order to receive the referral bonus seems somewhat counterintuitive. 
Typically, such processes are automated within the system or managed directly by the HR department. 
In many organizations, the responsibility for tracking and disbursing referral bonuses lies solely with HR, particularly once the referred employee has completed their six-month tenure.

It appears that this new policy may have been implemented due to difficulties in tracking these milestones within our department. 
While I appreciate the intent behind it, I believe it places an unnecessary burden on employees or on other department to remind and request bonuses that should be automatically processed.

### Reflection on Company Standards
Moreover, 
if we consider and keep saying ourselves a large company, it raises the question of why we are adopting practices more commonly associated with smaller organizations. 
In larger firms, such processes are typically streamlined and managed efficiently by HR without requiring constant reminders from employees. 
This current approach feels somewhat disheartening, as it suggests a lack of confidence in our ability to manage these processes effectively.

### Suggestion for Improvement 📌
As I live on the floor and have heard from colleagues about their concerns regarding this new policy, 
I suggest that we complete any pending bonuses for existing referrals under the previous system. 
This would help maintain a positive atmosphere and ensure fairness for those who have already referred candidates. 

### Conclusion

Ultimately, I understand that it is the company's prerogative to establish and enforce its policies. 
However, I felt it was important to share my perspective as both a former recruiter and a member of the Core Support Team. 
I believe that revisiting this process could enhance employee satisfaction and reflect our commitment to maintaining a professional and efficient work environment.

Thank you If You have reached here while reading and also for considering my feedback. I am open to discussing this matter further if needed.

or id that's coming from this route
template and which is replaced with 10
in this case it then goes through the
query parameters
and finds a match for the is test
parameter and then
maps that from string to boolean this is
how the model binding system
is working under the hood model binding
tries to populate
parameters of controller action methods
like the one here
parameters in razer pages and also
properties
with specific attributes in controllers
and razer pages
using the bind property attribute on
controllers
or razer pages causes model binding to
bind
to that particular property to see the
bind property in action
let's move the is test property from the
function method
to the class so let's delete this and
add in a property
is test to this controller class
so let's property and specify it as type
bool
and also specify this is is test for
this property to be bound by the model
binding system
let's add the attribute bind property

# since by defaultproperties are not bound on get requestwe need to explicitly turn that on using the supports get property on this attribute
so specifying that we can give in
supports get
and specify that to be true this is now
going to enable
binding this property to request even on
a get call
let's run this to see this in action
let's make a request
to this endpoint again passing in 10 and
is test
is equal to true the breakpoint is hit
and we have
the is test value still populated to be
true
this is now binding the values of the
class
since we have the bind property
attribute if you have
multiple public properties on this class
to be bound
by the model binding system we can
specify the bind properties
on the class level as well to do that
let's remove this
from here and specify an attribute for
the controller class
so that is going to be called bind
properties instead of
bind property so specifying that also
make sure
to specify supports get is equal to true
so that this still
works as expected if you have a
different property name
in the route data sources you can also
specify that
in the bind property attribute so let's
assume instead of
s test the parameter name is going to be
just
test to fix for that let's add in the
bind property
and specify the supports get is equal to
true
and also specify a name attribute that
will help us
to map the name from the route data that
this needs to match to
so let's say in this case this is going
to be just test
let's run this and see if it's working
as expected
since we no longer have is test and this
needs to be test
let's specify that and make a request so
in the query parameters
we have the variable test instead of is
test the breakpoint is hit
and we still have the is test property
populated
to be true this is because the binding
model system
reads this bind property and makes sure
that it's mapping to a name
which is of test instead of the is test
the model binding system
has multiple sources from which it
retrieves data
by default model binding gets data in
key value pairs
from different sources in the http
request it looks at these fields
in the following order so you can see
the form fields is looked first
followed by the request body and then
the route data
query string parameters and then
uploaded files
for each target parameter that's
specified it looks at these above
sources
in the specified order and tries to get
value from them
there are a few exceptions though the
route data and query string values
are used only for simple types and also
the uploaded files
is bound only to the target types that
implements
iform file or an ii enumerable of a form
file
this is particularly useful when you
want to upload documents
to the server and save that for your
application purposes
to see the order in which the model
binding is picking up
the data let's try that out with an
example so in our previous example
we had an id that was getting mapped to
10.
so if we were to pass an id as part of
the query string as well
that will be ignored this is because the
route data is given precedence
over the query string parameters let's
try that
and see for ourselves so let's pass in
an amazon
and specify id is equal to 100 however
this is going
to get ignored so let's see that and
pass in
the value this returns an id as 10 still
to verify let's change this to 9 and
make sure we are getting back
an iron this is the default behavior but
you can still override that to get this
to work and use the value
from the query parameters let's go back
to the source code
stop the application and for the id
parameter
let's specify this to be taken from the
query
so we can use the from and specify the
query
option so this is going to explicitly
set that this value needs to come from
the query
you no longer need this id in the route
template but let's leave it to make sure
that
this value is now getting from the query
so let's run this and make the same
request again
it successfully returns 100 and it has
started reading the value
from the query parameters instead of the
route template which was 9
in this case similar to the from query
attribute
you also have the from body the from
form
the from header and the from route you
can use these attributes to explicitly
set
the source for that particular parameter
the from services
is not related to the model binding even
though it's named similar
this is to work with dependency
injection and not anything to do with
the model binding system
so let's ignore that similar to the bind
property that we saw before
we can specify a name that this property
needs to map to
when specifying the from attributes for
example
let's specify from header and specify
the name and give
the name to be accept language so this
is going to map to the request header
except language we can then
map this to be the property string and
language
to see this in action let's also return
that back so let's specify language
and the parameter that we just wrote so
let's run this application
and see this working let's make the same
request again this now returns the
accept language header values
that's getting sent as part of the
request to see that in the request
you can open up the network tab in your
browser and make the request again
so you can see the http request that's
getting made and see the headers
in here we have an accept language
header that's getting passed with the
same value
in here we've been looking at simple
types in the dotnet
that's getting mapped to the request so
simple types are like boolean
byte care date time string etc
you can find the list of values in here
in the documentation
this will be linked in the description
below a complex type
for example which is a class which has
multiple properties
it needs to have a public default
constructor and public writable
properties
so that the model binding system can
bind to it
when the model binding occurs the class
is instantiated using the public
constructor let's see this in action so
let's go back
to our source code and move these
properties into a class
let's create a new class with the name
my complex type
this is going to have the id property
which is an
end we have a string which is the accept
language
which has the language as the property
name and also we have the is test which
is a boolean
so let's specify bool as test since we
have not specified any constructor
the default constructor is still
applicable in here
this needs to come from the query we can
specify the language
to come from the header like we used it
before so we can copy this value from
header
except language take that in and specify
it
for this particular property and for
boolean using the bind
property and mapping this to test
let's come back to the controller and
update these parameters
to use the new complex type that we just
wrote let's specify
the complex type as a parameter instead
of these
so let's use the my complex type and
specify a name
my complex type we can now update these
properties
to reflect from the my complex type
properties
so let's do that using my complex type
and using
the appropriate properties from the
complex types let's also change the
language
to use it from the complex type complex
types by default are not mapped to
queries or route data
to explicitly map them we can specify
the from query
or the from route in here let's specify
from query since that's where we
want these values to be mapped and
inside the properties
we have applied these from parameters
which is also going to work
in this case so let's run this and see
this in action
let's make this request again it has hit
the break point
and we can see the my complex type is
now getting populated
with the appropriate values so we have
the hundred
that's getting populated here and the is
test is true
and also values from the header as
before so now we have successfully
mapped
data from the request into a complex
data type so let's resume this execution
and it returns back the values as
expected we can now
change the values here let's say if we
make this 99
and we get the id to be 99 as expected
we can also send
collections of data in the request to
see this in action
let's go to our my complex type and add
a collection property
let's specify a new property which can
be an end array
and let's name this as marks let's put a
breakpoint here
to make sure this is working as expected
let's run this
to pass data for the new marks property
that we just created
there are multiple conventions that we
can use the easiest
is to pass in multiple marks attribute
as part of the query parameter
so let's specify ampersand and say
marks is equal to one and again specify
another parameter
marks is equal to two and make the
request
the breakpoint is hit and let's see the
my complex type
in this case we can see the marks has
two values that's populated
one and two in here this is because in
the request
we have two parameters with the same
name and it automatically maps
to this collection property
alternatively you can also specify
by giving indexes for these values so if
i pass in
the marks of 1 to b is index 0
and also the marks 2 to be at index 1
this is also going to work we can see
that the marks are still populated
in the same order 0 and 1 since we gave
it as
1 and 2. if we change the order of these
indexes let's say we make the first one
as 1
and the second one as 0 this order is
going to be maintained
when we get the particular value in the
complex type
so let's make the request and go back to
the server and we see that the values
are now
in this new order 2 and 1 because of the
indexes that we specified
if we skip an index in this new format
let's say instead of specifying 1
we gave this as 2 this value is going to
get
ignored let's go back to the breakpoint
and we can see that
now the complex type has only one value
under marks
which is 2. so if there is a gap in
these indexes
any values after the gap gets ignored so
make sure
if you're using this new format that
there is no gap when you are specifying
the values
in the query parameter similar to
collections we can also pass in
dictionary of values to see this in
action let's change
the property that we just added from an
array to a dictionary of string
and ins so let's specify dictionary and
given
string of integer so this has a string
key
and an integer value let's run this
instead of the integer indexes
we can now specify string values so
let's say
marks of different subjects we can give
in english
and also we can give in max so let's
make this request it has hit the
breakpoint and we have the marks
now populated so we have the english
and max values getting passed in as
expected
if you specify the same key for multiple
dictionary objects it's going to ignore
anything after the first one so in this
case if i pass in
english and english it's only going to
take the one with the value 1
because that comes first so let's make
this request
and verify that's working as expected so
we have the my complex type
and we have only one value that's coming
in marks which is
the value 1. till now we saw the values
coming from the route and query
parameters
you can also pass in data as part of
your request body
the data in the request body can be of
different formats
for example it can be in json it can be
in xml
or any other custom format that you
choose for your application
to parse this data that comes as part of
request body
the model binding system uses input
formatters
by default asp.net core comes with a
json input formatter
you can also add in more input
formatters and customize it for yourself
let's see how this works in action let's
come back to our controller code
and let's add in a new class to capture
the data from this body
so let's add in a new class and call
this my custom
data this is going to have two
properties let's say
end an id and also a string
name let's come back to the controller
and add in a new http post method that i
have already written out
so this is taking in the my custom data
that we just wrote
and returns back the id and the name
from that let's run this application
and see this in action since this is an
http post
i cannot invoke this from the browser so
let me use
a tool called postman which helps me to
send http requests
you can download this for free and the
link is there in the description below
i have a request already set up for this
to post the json format
so the url is as expected the one that
we were
having as default for the application
and inside the body
i have the data being sent so i have the
id
and the name property that's being sent
for the my custom data
i have also specified the type to be
json
by the drop down in here note this is
also a post
request that's getting sent to this url
let's make a request
and see what we get back so we get one
and the name
that we send in which is basically the
id and the name
that we send in the controller is
returning us back exactly the same
information since asp.net core by
default has
json formatters added this was working
out of the box
however let's say your application needs
the data to be sent
in an xml format so if i was to come
back
and make a request with this data in xml
this is not going to work
so let's make a post xml request which
is exactly the same
except for the body being now in xml
format
and i have also specified the type to be
xml
so let's send this request and this is
going to return back
an error saying unsupported media type
to start supporting this
we need to add in xml formatters so that
the model binding system
can understand the body data that's in
xml format
to do that let's go back to the
application stop this
and add a new get package as you would
expect so let's open up the
solution explorer and say manage nuget
packages
to add in xml support we need to add a
new get package which is microsoft
asp.net core mvc formatters.xml so you
can select that
and install this to the model binding
project once confirmed
it's going to install this nuget package
into this project
it's all successfully installed so let's
go to the startup class
and add in the support for this xml
formatters
to do that in the configure services
method let's say services
dot add controllers and specify in the
add
xml serializer formatters this is the
way you can register formatters
and this is going to add in the xml
serializer formatter
for this application now that we have
the xml formatter specified let's run
this
to see it in action let's go back to
postman and make a request again with
the xml data
let's click send and now we get the
value back which is 12
and the name from xml as passed in this
request body
you can change this and this will start
reflecting here in your response
because that's what the controller is
doing note that the post json also works
because that formatter is also supported
in this particular application
right now so if i was to make a json
request that is also working
asp.net core is looking at the content
type
in the request headers to infer the
format that's coming in
if you want to see the content type in
postman you can click the console button
up here and you can see each of the
requests that's getting sent
let's clear this and make a request
again so here
if we were to expand this particular
request we can see the value for the
content type
this is specified as content type
application json
this is because i set it as json in the
drop down box here
if i change this to let's say text it's
going to send in
as text so let's clear this log again
and make a request
when we made it text we got back the
same error unsupported
media type if we expand the request we
can see that
the request has content type to be now
text
plain let's switch that back to json
similarly for xml you would expect this
value to be
xml because of which the controller is
working for both the formatters
if you want to restrict the controller
to a specific formatter
let's say xml you can go back to the
source code
and on the controller you can specify a
consumes
attribute to do that in the weather
forecast controller let's add in
the consumes attribute at the controller
level
so we can specify consumes and a list of
strings which is marking the content
type
in this case we can specify it to be
application
xml only let's run this application go
back to postman
and make an xml request this still works
as expected
however if we were to go back to postman
and post a json
this is going to now fail saying
unsupported media type
because we restricted the controller
using the consumes attribute
to serve only xml requests if you want
to support both
you can either go back and remove that
or add an explicitly an
application json as well to the consumes
attribute
so to do that let's specify application
json
this is going to now work for both xml
and json
running the application again and going
back to postman
we can successfully make a json request
as well
and an xml request as well this is
because
the consumes now supports both these
content types
the my custom data in the post method
here is getting inferred
using the input formatters so in this
case if you were to specify
binding properties on this classes it's
going to get ignored
this is because it's not the model
binding system that's converting the
body
into this particular object it is the
input formatter
so if you want to override let's say a
specific property
name like we saw the is test to be
mapped with test
etc you will need to write a custom
formatter
and plug that in into the system we will
not cover that
in this video but just be aware you will
have to write custom formatters
to achieve that by default we saw the
different sources
that the binding system uses if you want
to extend this
and use from custom sources in the
request you can do that as well
you will need to write a class that
implements an i-value provider
another one that has the i-value
provider factory and register these
classes in your configure services
method
you can see an example in the
documentation here which will be linked
below
i hope this helps you to understand more
about the model binding
system in asp.net core and how it works
under the hoods
we saw the different ways that the
binding system gets data from the
request
and maps it into the properties of the
controllers
this is very similar to how it would
work when you're using razer pages

i think all this shit idea won't work..

i tried and below forumula gives me result

where  A is "Purchase Date" column, D is "Purchase Price" column, E is "Expense Type" column.

but it has only one issue
why there is sum word there for the 'Celebration' , which is one of the category and on right of that "sum 2025" is displayed.

1. Utilizing the QUERY Function

The QUERY function in Google Sheets allows you to perform data manipulations similar to SQL queries, enabling dynamic data summarization without pivot tables. For instance, to calculate the total expenses per category, you can use:

plaintext
Copy code
=QUERY(A1:C, "SELECT B, SUM(C) GROUP BY B", 1)

Act as a very very senior person in IT industry having 3 decades of experience and Answer me below question.

I am an experienced Developer who has worked on various technologies for 6 years. i have started with 
native android app development using java for 6 months 
then in parallel 3 to 4 months for ionic cordova and native android app development using java for 6 months
then react native for 8 months
then i changed the company and there i have worked on ionic cordova and ionic capacior for 3 years.
then i changed the company and started exploring AI tools for 6 months and in parallel explored react web.
then for the 8 months i have worked on enterprise level project where they are using the dotnet MVC and react for their project and i used to work on UI fixes only on mvc side, so i have worked on html css related stuff only and fixed some minor functional issues like validation message dispalyed or not displayed.but now in that project the company wants the full stack dev only and Either with React or Web API skil and i dont have any of them at perfect level. so they decided to remove me by this end of month.

So i am now standing at total of 6.5 years of exeperience but the tech stack is so disturbed that i am not feeling confident at anything.

so Answer my  below questions ?
1. Does all this is mistake that i should not have been done ?
2. How this can be fixed ?

Now my company want me to prepare for the C# Web API Development and want me to be expert at it. how can i do that. i need detailed plan to master it.
i want list of every small topic that needs to be covered to master the C# Web API Development perfectly that i can ready to be jumped to any project.

so create me a plan of 1 month (22 business days) where i can learn C# Web API Development 4-5 hrs a day along with practise as i am occupied in some  project task in other time so i have 5 hrs only for React learning.
make sure to keep in mind that i am not noobie to C# Web API Development i already have an idea about basics like component, state, props as i have worked in react native and also have touchbase with react. so create my plan accordingly and make sure to include the perfect resources for every small topic that i can go through for that topic and i dont need to search anything extra for that topic.

Note. include the latest resource URL not the old C# Web API Development doc URL.

ALso give me the best youtube Playlist that help me to learn faster.

### Nidhi
Everything going well. I have not worked with her directly but have seen her working in our group and she is communicating well on result verification or anything she is working.

I have not worked with her directly so not sure about this but yes things always can be done better.

We are working together indirectly since long and have not heard anything negative about her so the overall impact is excellent.

We are working together but indirectly so i can't give any feedback from my standpoint.

### Samirkumar Makvana
Everything is going well. 
I worked with him when I joined AH and it's quite good to work with him.
He knows the functionality very well so it is easy for me to reach out and clear any doubt on the fly.
He communicates well in groups and in person too.

yes things always can be done better.

We are working together in beginning and now in diff team  but have not heard anything negative about him so the overall impact is excellent. and he is doing excellent in OE team.

Attention to detail can be improved, once in a moon , small bug can be left so yes more attention can avoid this as well and rest is alreaady awesome.

in my office i am handling admin department. we just renovated the cafeteria with new tables and beautiful chairs so for that and in generally we want to make some rules to keep it clean and looks good . so can you write above things in professional way for the employees.


As we have renovated our cafeteria, we want you to take care of things like below.
1. Table arrangements can not be changed.
2. Dont put your tiffin bag or box or tea time snack dabbas like Mamra or anything on tables. Take back to Home as well once finished.
3. If you are ordering Tiffin then also keep in our cupboards not on the tables. 
4. Ordered food can be kept on table until you come or if you keep for any of your friend or team member, but take care to dont keep it open or on table for hours.
5. In fridge, If you keep something and haven't eat/drink , then take back to home but dont keep in fridge till next day or for long. 

REVISION :
6. Alreaedy mentioned previously but still lot of people not closing the cupboard once used. Please close it. there is already key inserted for that.


Please let me know 1:1 if you have any questions or confusion regarding anything.
