============================================================
Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. 

As someone who has previously worked as a recruiter, I understand how eagerly employees anticipate their referral bonuses. 
However, I would like to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the new process for claiming these bonuses.

### Current Process Concerns

The requirement to create a helpdesk ticket in order to receive the referral bonus seems somewhat counterintuitive. 
Typically, such processes are automated within the system or managed directly by the HR department. 
In many organizations, the responsibility for tracking and disbursing referral bonuses lies solely with HR, particularly once the referred employee has completed their six-month tenure.

It appears that this new policy may have been implemented due to difficulties in tracking these milestones within our department. 
While I appreciate the intent behind it, I believe it places an unnecessary burden on employees or on other department to remind and request bonuses that should be automatically processed.

### Reflection on Company Standards
Moreover, 
if we consider and keep saying ourselves a large company, it raises the question of why we are adopting practices more commonly associated with smaller organizations. 
In larger firms, such processes are typically streamlined and managed efficiently by HR without requiring constant reminders from employees. 
This current approach feels somewhat disheartening, as it suggests a lack of confidence in our ability to manage these processes effectively.

### Suggestion for Improvement 📌
As I live on the floor and have heard from colleagues about their concerns regarding this new policy, 
I suggest that we complete any pending bonuses for existing referrals under the previous system. 
This would help maintain a positive atmosphere and ensure fairness for those who have already referred candidates. 

### Conclusion

Ultimately, I understand that it is the company's prerogative to establish and enforce its policies. 
However, I felt it was important to share my perspective as both a former recruiter and a member of the Core Support Team. 
I believe that revisiting this process could enhance employee satisfaction and reflect our commitment to maintaining a professional and efficient work environment.

Thank you If You have reached here while reading and also for considering my feedback. I am open to discussing this matter further if needed.

1. Utilizing the QUERY Function

The QUERY function in Google Sheets allows you to perform data manipulations similar to SQL queries, enabling dynamic data summarization without pivot tables. For instance, to calculate the total expenses per category, you can use:

plaintext
Copy code
=QUERY(A1:C, "SELECT B, SUM(C) GROUP BY B", 1)

Act as a very very senior person in IT industry having 3 decades of experience and Answer me below question.

I am an experienced Developer who has worked on various technologies for 6 years. i have started with 
native android app development using java for 6 months 
then in parallel 3 to 4 months for ionic cordova and native android app development using java for 6 months
then react native for 8 months
then i changed the company and there i have worked on ionic cordova and ionic capacior for 3 years.
then i changed the company and started exploring AI tools for 6 months and in parallel explored react web.
then for the 8 months i have worked on enterprise level project where they are using the dotnet MVC and react for their project and i used to work on UI fixes only on mvc side, so i have worked on html css related stuff only and fixed some minor functional issues like validation message dispalyed or not displayed.but now in that project the company wants the full stack dev only and Either with React or Web API skil and i dont have any of them at perfect level. so they decided to remove me by this end of month.

So i am now standing at total of 6.5 years of exeperience but the tech stack is so disturbed that i am not feeling confident at anything.

so Answer my  below questions ?
1. Does all this is mistake that i should not have been done ?
2. How this can be fixed ?

Now my company want me to prepare for the C# Web API Development and want me to be expert at it. how can i do that. i need detailed plan to master it.
i want list of every small topic that needs to be covered to master the C# Web API Development perfectly that i can ready to be jumped to any project.

so create me a plan of 1 month (22 business days) where i can learn C# Web API Development 4-5 hrs a day along with practise as i am occupied in some  project task in other time so i have 5 hrs only for React learning.
make sure to keep in mind that i am not noobie to C# Web API Development i already have an idea about basics like component, state, props as i have worked in react native and also have touchbase with react. so create my plan accordingly and make sure to include the perfect resources for every small topic that i can go through for that topic and i dont need to search anything extra for that topic.

Note. include the latest resource URL not the old C# Web API Development doc URL.

ALso give me the best youtube Playlist that help me to learn faster.

### Nidhi
Everything going well. I have not worked with her directly but have seen her working in our group and she is communicating well on result verification or anything she is working.

I have not worked with her directly so not sure about this but yes things always can be done better.

We are working together indirectly since long and have not heard anything negative about her so the overall impact is excellent.

We are working together but indirectly so i can't give any feedback from my standpoint.

### Samirkumar Makvana
Everything is going well. 
I worked with him when I joined AH and it's quite good to work with him.
He knows the functionality very well so it is easy for me to reach out and clear any doubt on the fly.
He communicates well in groups and in person too.

yes things always can be done better.

We are working together in beginning and now in diff team  but have not heard anything negative about him so the overall impact is excellent. and he is doing excellent in OE team.

Attention to detail can be improved, once in a moon , small bug can be left so yes more attention can avoid this as well and rest is alreaady awesome.

in my office i am handling admin department. we just renovated the cafeteria with new tables and beautiful chairs so for that and in generally we want to make some rules to keep it clean and looks good . so can you write above things in professional way for the employees.


As we have renovated our cafeteria, we want you to take care of things like below.
1. Table arrangements can not be changed.
2. Dont put your tiffin bag or box or tea time snack dabbas like Mamra or anything on tables. Take back to Home as well once finished.
3. If you are ordering Tiffin then also keep in our cupboards not on the tables. 
4. Ordered food can be kept on table until you come or if you keep for any of your friend or team member, but take care to dont keep it open or on table for hours.
5. In fridge, If you keep something and haven't eat/drink , then take back to home but dont keep in fridge till next day or for long. 

REVISION :
6. Alreaedy mentioned previously but still lot of people not closing the cupboard once used. Please close it. there is already key inserted for that.


Please let me know 1:1 if you have any questions or confusion regarding anything.
