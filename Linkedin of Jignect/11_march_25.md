This is a fantastic tool from Postman! We've recently started exploring the Data Visualization template at JigNect, and it's already proving incredibly useful.

Visualizing complex API responses helps us with data validation, making it easier to spot trends and potential issues. This is especially beneficial when we need to provide valuable insights to our clients about their databases.

Speaking of API testing, if you're just getting started, check out our blog on the essentials of API testing in Postman: https://jignect.tech/a-beginners-guide-to-api-testing-in-postman/

If you're looking to level up your API testing game or need assistance with QA automation strategies, connect with us!

### My Comment
Really insightful webinar from Katalon and Appdome! The discussion around using AI to combat fraud and ensure mobile app security is timely, especially with the rise of deep fakes and sophisticated attacks.

I appreciate the focus on end-to-end platform approaches to eliminate security conflicts and improve user experience. The point about mobile users advocating for apps that protect them (93%!) is a key takeaway.

At JigNect, we're committed to delivering comprehensive QA solutions that integrate functional and non-functional testing, including security. We leverage tools like Katalon, combined with our expertise in API, mobile, and web automation. Our goal is to accelerate releases without compromising security or user experience.

### My Comment
Exciting to see you starting your journey with REST Assured! 

It's indeed a powerful tool for API automation. One common challenge in API testing is managing complex microservices, which can lead to delays and inconsistencies. 

At Jignect, We helped a gaming client overcome this by implementing automated API testing for their microservices architecture, ensuring seamless integration and efficiency. 

Check out our case study: https://jignect.tech/project/api-test-automation-for-gaming-application-built-on-microservices-architecture/.
