### My Comment
Great guide to API testing!

At JigNect, we've seen firsthand how crucial API testing is for ensuring seamless integration, performance, and security across applications.

One of our notable projects involved automating API tests for a gaming application built on a microservices architecture. We used tools like HTTP C# Client and SpecFlow to create a robust test automation framework, integrating it with Azure DevOps for continuous testing. This approach significantly reduced testing time, improved quality, and enhanced test coverage. You can read more about this case study here:

API testing is indeed vital for catching defects early, improving performance, and automating releases. If you're looking to enhance your API testing strategies or need assistance with automation, feel free to connect with us! "Quality is not an act, it is a habit.

Exciting to see you starting your journey with REST Assured! 

It's indeed a powerful tool for API automation. One common challenge in API testing is managing complex microservices, which can lead to delays and inconsistencies. 

At Jignect, We helped a gaming client overcome this by implementing automated API testing for their microservices architecture, ensuring seamless integration and efficiency.

### My Comment
Insightful post, Laxman!

That 1-second delay statistic is a powerful reminder of how critical performance testing is for customer satisfaction and retention. Your breakdown of the types of performance testingâ€”Load, Stress, Soak, and Enduranceâ€”is spot on and highlights how essential it is to ensure apps perform seamlessly under all conditions.

At JigNect, weâ€™ve had the privilege of tackling similar challenges. In one of our projects, we conducted performance testing for a medical staffing services web application using JMeter. This helped identify bottlenecks and optimize system stability under varying loads. 

If you're curious about how we approached it, hereâ€™s the case study: https://jignect.tech/project/performance-testing-of-a-medical-staffing-services-web-application-using-jmeter/.

Keep sharing such valuable insightsâ€”posts like these truly elevate the software testing community!
