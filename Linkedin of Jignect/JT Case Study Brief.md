## API Testing

### API Test Automation For Gaming Application Built On Microservices Architecture

One of our notable projects involved automating API tests for a gaming application built on a microservices architecture. We used tools like HTTP C# Client and SpecFlow to create a robust test automation framework, integrating it with Azure DevOps for continuous testing. This approach significantly reduced testing time, improved quality, and enhanced test coverage. You can read more about this case study here:

### Implemented Web/Mobile UI/API Test Automation Solutions for Medical Staffing Services

We also successfully implemented a comprehensive test automation framework for a U.S.-based medical staffing services company. The framework integrated UI and API automation using tools like Selenium, Appium, and HTTP C# Client, ensuring compatibility across multiple browsers and platforms. By leveraging Azure DevOps for CI/CD, we significantly improved testing efficiency, enhanced test coverage, and facilitated early bug detection. This approach allowed the team to focus on more complex testing scenarios while reducing manual testing efforts and costs.
