### My Comment
Such an exciting and timely comparison! 

Both Appium and Playwright are incredible tools, and it’s great to see their strengths laid out so clearly for 2025. Appium is still the go-to for mobile app testing, especially for native apps, while Playwright is redefining web automation with its speed, reliability, and cross-browser capabilities.

At JigNect, we’ve worked extensively with both tools to create scalable and efficient test automation frameworks. For those diving into Appium, check out our guide here: 
https://jignect.tech/appium-setup-a-step-by-step-guide-for-beginner/. 

And if you’re exploring Playwright, our blog on streamlining mobile automation with Playwright and TypeScript is a must-read:

### My Comment
Automation truly has a way of humbling even the most confident among us! The journey you described—starting with excitement and then facing real-world challenges—is something every automation professional can relate to. It’s not just about setting up workflows; it’s about navigating integrations, handling edge cases, and solving real-life problems that make us better at what we do.

The beauty of automation lies in its ability to push us beyond our limits, forcing us to learn, adapt, and grow. And yes, while AI might replace repetitive manual tasks, it will never replace the mindset and critical thinking required to design robust automation solutions.

At JigNect, we embrace this challenge every day, blending tools like Selenium, Cypress, and Appium with innovative strategies to tackle complex scenarios.

### My Comment
Such an exciting concept! Making Selenium automation accessible through a web-based portal for non-technical users is a game-changer. By enabling users to execute test cases with just a click, track results, and reduce dependencies, this approach not only simplifies workflows but also bridges the gap between technical and non-technical teams.

One potential challenge could be ensuring robust handling of dynamic elements and maintaining the scalability of the portal as test suites grow. Additionally, incorporating features like parallel execution or integration with cloud grids (e.g., BrowserStack or Sauce Labs) could further enhance efficiency and reduce execution times.

This idea aligns with the future of testing—collaborative, user-friendly, and efficient. Would love to explore how reporting and debugging tools can be integrated into this portal for even greater visibility. 

Kudos for thinking outside the box!

## 3. Japneed Sachdeva - let's not forget manual testing

### My Comment
Absolutely love this perspective! Manual testing is indeed the unsung hero of software quality assurance. While automation excels at repetitive tasks and regression testing, manual testing brings the human touch—critical for exploratory testing, usability evaluation, and uncovering hidden issues that automation might overlook.

We’ve seen the value of combining manual and automated approaches firsthand in our company. For instance, in one of our case studies, we implemented mobile app UI automation for a GST billing application. While automation ensured efficiency, manual testing played a crucial role in verifying GST calculations and usability across diverse scenarios. You can check out the full case study here:
https://jignect.tech/project/implemented-mobile-app-ui-automation-for-gst-billing-application-android-ios/

A balanced QA strategy leveraging both manual and automated testing is the key to delivering high-quality software. Thanks for highlighting this important topic!

Let’s celebrate the brilliance of manual testers—true guardians of quality!

## 2. Kushal Parikh - SpecFlow is Dead ? How to implement BDD now ?

### Post URL :

### My Comment
SpecFlow’s end-of-life marks a significant shift in the BDD landscape, but it also opens doors to innovation. While SpecFlow has been instrumental in integrating BDD into .NET ecosystems, its discontinuation highlights the importance of adaptability in QA practices. Tools like Reqnroll have stepped up as a seamless successor, offering .NET 8+ support and modern features like scenario-level parallelization, ensuring teams can continue their BDD journey without disruption.

At JigNect, we’ve helped teams transition smoothly from SpecFlow by leveraging tools like Reqnroll while enhancing testing frameworks with Selenium, Cypress, and Postman. Our focus remains on aligning BDD with real-world user behavior, not just Gherkin syntax. For those exploring alternatives, reporting tools like Allure Reports integrated with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps) can provide actionable insights.

Check out our blog on BDD best practices for more insights into transitioning from SpecFlow and optimizing your BDD strategy.

 Let’s keep quality at the forefront of innovation!
