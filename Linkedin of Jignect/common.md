# Manual Testing in IMP

Manual testing remains a cornerstone of QA, even in an automation-driven world. It brings the human perspective that automation simply cannot replicate, especially for exploratory testing, real-user simulations, and identifying subtle UI/UX issues. Flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements make it indispensable, particularly in early development stages or short-term projects.

We’ve seen the value of combining manual and automated approaches firsthand in our company. For instance, in one of our case studies, we implemented mobile app UI automation for a GST billing application. While automation ensured efficiency, manual testing played a crucial role in verifying GST calculations and usability across diverse scenarios. You can check out the full case study here:

A balanced QA strategy leveraging both manual and automated testing is the key to delivering high-quality software.

===========
Absolutely love this perspective! Manual testing is indeed the unsung hero of software quality assurance. While automation excels at repetitive tasks and regression testing, manual testing brings the human touch—critical for exploratory testing, usability evaluation, and uncovering hidden issues that automation might overlook.

Manual testers are the ones who step into the shoes of end-users, ensuring the software delivers an exceptional experience. Their adaptability and intuition make them irreplaceable, even in a world increasingly driven by AI. As you rightly said, testing is a mindset, not just a task!

At JigNect, we embrace both manual and automated testing to craft robust QA strategies.
