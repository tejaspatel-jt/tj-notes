### My Comment
Fantastic checklist, Test Evolve! Selecting the right test automation tool is indeed a cornerstone of building a robust QA strategy. 

At JigNect, we’ve encountered similar challenges and successfully tackled them for our clients. For instance, we recently partnered with a leading FinTech company to enhance their mobile test automation using WebdriverIO and Appium. By upgrading their framework and achieving 100% automation coverage, we helped them streamline test execution and improve app reliability across Android and iOS platforms.

If you're interested in how we approached this, check out the case study here:

Thanks for sharing these valuable insights!

Postman's documentation is a lifesaver! 

Clear, step-by-step guides are essential for mastering API testing. 

Speaking of which, for those just starting out, we at JigNect have put together a beginner's guide to API testing in Postman that you might find helpful: https://jignect.tech/a-beginners-guide-to-api-testing-in-postman/ 

Happy testing!

### My Comment
Great advice, Naveen! 

Jumping into tools without mastering the fundamentals is like building a house on shaky ground. Your emphasis on understanding core JavaScript/TypeScript concepts resonates deeply with the challenges many testers face today. 

Thanks for sharing these valuable resources—continuous learning is truly the key to thriving in test automation!
