The Harsh Truth About Software Testing & Automation

Let’s be real—many people enter software testing because they don’t want to write code. 

But here’s where reality hits:
 - Manual testing is still essential—even with automation, test cases are often manually verified because management doesn’t fully trust automation results.
 - The market demand is low—yet companies post Automation Engineer vacancies even if they don’t actually work on automation.
 - The salary game is unfair—companies expect every skill but offer minimal pay in return.
 - LinkedIn is full of automation hype—only for some to sell their paid courses later.

Automation matters, but manual testing isn’t going anywhere. The real challenge is balancing skills, industry expectations, and career growth.

What’s your take? Do you think automation is overhyped or necessary?

now we at jignect are purely automation focused company and you know very well about us what we do and how we do

My Suggested Comments

Highlighting the Importance of Automation:
While it's true that manual testing still has its place, the reality is that automation is crucial for efficiency and scalability in software testing. At JigNect, we've seen firsthand how automation can transform testing processes, allowing teams to focus on high-value tasks rather than repetitive ones. The hype around automation isn't just hype; it's about staying competitive in a fast-paced tech landscape. Balancing skills and expectations is indeed a challenge, but investing in automation skills is essential for career growth and meeting industry demands. For a concrete example of how we've helped a food ordering solution achieve these benefits, check out our case study: https://jignect.tech/project/web-mobile-ui-test-automation-using-selenium-appium-for-food-ordering-solution/
Addressing the Misconceptions:
It's understandable to feel that automation is overhyped, but the truth is, it's a necessity for companies looking to innovate and stay ahead. While manual testing is essential for certain aspects, automation is what allows teams to scale and ensure consistent quality across large and complex systems. The demand for automation engineers might seem low in some areas, but the reality is that companies are increasingly recognizing the value of automation in reducing costs and improving efficiency. At JigNect, we're committed to helping businesses leverage automation effectively. See how we did this for a food ordering service in our case study: https://jignect.tech/project/web-mobile-ui-test-automation-using-selenium-appium-for-food-ordering-solution/
Focusing on Career Growth:
The real challenge isn't whether automation is overhyped or necessary; it's about how we prepare ourselves for the future of testing. As automation continues to evolve, it's crucial for testers to develop skills that complement automation tools. At JigNect, we believe in empowering testers with the right automation tools and strategies to enhance their careers and contribute to more efficient testing processes. The salary game might be unfair in some cases, but investing in automation skills can open doors to better opportunities and higher pay in the long run. We've seen this firsthand with our clients – check out this case study for more: https://jignect.tech/project/web-mobile-ui-test-automation-using-selenium-appium-for-food-ordering-solution/
Emphasizing the Role of Automation in Innovation:
Automation isn't just about replacing manual testing; it's about enabling innovation and faster time-to-market. By automating repetitive tasks, teams can focus on more strategic and creative work. At JigNect, we're passionate about helping companies harness the power of automation to drive innovation and competitiveness. While there might be some hype around automation, the reality is that it's a critical component of modern software development and testing strategies.
