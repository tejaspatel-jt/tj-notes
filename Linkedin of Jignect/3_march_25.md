### My Comment
Fantastic post! 
The Page Object Model (POM) is indeed a game-changer for Selenium automation, making frameworks more structured, scalable, and easier to maintain. By separating UI elements from test logic, POM ensures cleaner code and reduces maintenance efforts—essential for any robust automation strategy.

We’ve also explored POM extensively in our blog, where we dive deep into its implementation using Selenium with C# and NUnit. It’s a great resource for anyone looking to master POM:

Additionally, we at Jignect, implemented POM in  one of our fintech investment app. By leveraging WebDriverIO and Appium, we automated complex UI and API scenarios across web and mobile platforms. This approach improved test efficiency, scalability, and ensured seamless regression testing. You can check out the details here:

POM truly empowers automation engineers to build frameworks that are not only efficient but also future-proof. 

Thanks for sharing this valuable insight!

### My Comment
Such a relatable and insightful post! 

Raj’s journey highlights the importance of balancing automation skills with a strong foundation in manual testing. While automation is powerful, manual testing remains essential for exploratory testing, real-user simulations, and catching edge cases that automation often misses. It’s the human touch that ensures software truly meets user expectations.

👉For those looking to strengthen their skills, our QA blog has a wealth of resources to learn and upskill: https://jignect.tech/qa-blog/

We recently worked on a project for a U.S.-based medical staffing platform where we implemented Web/Mobile UI and API test automation. By leveraging tools like Selenium, Appium, and C# integrated with Azure DevOps, we created a scalable framework that supported multiple browsers and platforms. This reduced manual effort, enhanced test coverage, enabled early bug detection, and ensured reliable regression testing. You can read the full case study here:

Raj’s story is a great reminder that combining manual testing expertise with automation strategies leads to a well-rounded QA approach.

### My Comment
Absolutely agree! 

Manual testing remains a cornerstone of QA, even in an automation-driven world. It brings the human perspective that automation simply cannot replicate, especially for exploratory testing, real-user simulations, and identifying subtle UI/UX issues. Flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements make it indispensable, particularly in early development stages or short-term projects.

We’ve seen the value of combining manual and automated approaches firsthand in our company. For instance, in one of our case studies, we implemented mobile app UI automation for a GST billing application. While automation ensured efficiency, manual testing played a crucial role in verifying GST calculations and usability across diverse scenarios. You can check out the full case study here:

A balanced QA strategy leveraging both manual and automated testing is the key to delivering high-quality software. Thanks for highlighting this important topic!

### My Comment
This is super exciting! UiPath Autopilot™ sounds like a game-changer for testers. 

The ability to generate code from text is something many of us have dreamed about! It's incredible how AI is making test automation more efficient and accessible.

The feature We are most excited about is the auto-generation of test data based on prompts. High-quality test data is often a bottleneck, and this could really speed up the testing process. Also, verifying the quality of error messages using GenAI activities is a brilliant way to ensure a better user experience.

As a company specializing in test automation, we're always looking for tools that can enhance productivity and accuracy. We'll definitely be exploring UiPath Autopilot™ to see how it can fit into our toolkit! 

Thanks Vishal Kalra for sharing this; it's a great step forward for the testing community!

Shift Left Testing is truly a game-changer in modern software development!

Starting testing early in the SDLC not only ensures higher-quality software but also saves time and costs by catching defects when they’re easiest to fix. The emphasis on collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders, combined with automation and continuous feedback, makes this approach a cornerstone of agile practices.

We’ve seen firsthand how early adoption of practices like unit testing, static code analysis, and API testing can drastically improve stability and accelerate time-to-market. It’s amazing to see the industry embracing smarter strategies like this to deliver high-performing applications. 

👌Great post & Thanks for highlighting the importance of proactive testing!

### My Comment 
Such an insightful breakdown of the Bug Life Cycle! 👏 It's fascinating how each stage plays a pivotal role in ensuring software quality. 

At JigNect, we believe that a well-structured bug life cycle isn't just a process—it's the backbone of delivering reliable, high-performing software.

From identifying the bug to closing it, every step requires collaboration, precision, and the right tools. We’ve seen how leveraging tools like JIRA, Selenium, and Postman can streamline this process and ensure no bug slips through the cracks.

By the way, for those who’ve faced this question in interviews: remember, it's not just about naming the stages but also explaining their significance and how they interconnect in real-world scenarios. That’s where you stand out! 🚀

We recently shared a blog on 'A Beginner's Guide to API Testing in Postman'—perfect for anyone looking to enhance their API testing skills. Feel free to check it out here: https://jignect.tech/a-beginners-guide-to-api-testing-in-postman/.

Let’s keep sharing and learning from each other—because quality is not just a phase; it’s a way of life. 💡
